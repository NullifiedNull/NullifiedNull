Hi I'm NullifiedNull, but you can just call me Null. I am self-teaching myself programming. I am currently aiming to learn HTML/CSS and Javascript. I want to at some point become a web developer and maybe
in an even further future, become a game developer as well.
I hope to to do cool and unique things, and aim to constantly improve.
